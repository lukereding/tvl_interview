# TVL Case Study Interview

## what do these guys need to do to make money?
- convince local / state / federal aid agencies that they need this training
- pass bills at the local / state / federal level to allocate tax dollars to this training

## suggestions
- what would it take to expand to Latin America / East Asian countries?
- Does the pricing really make sense? Given they want to a target companies with >100 people?

## to research
- How much does, e.g., the Red Cross spend on services like this? What about police / fire departments?
- “As natural disasters and threats of progressive violence against law enforcement and fellow citizens increase, first-aid techniques, training, and resources of civilian organizations will become increasingly stretched and will not be enough to address future catastrophes” pg. 4 — is this true?
- pg. 6 — “Educational grants are expected to rise and healthcare infrastructure is expected to improve in support of this growing segment.” True?
- How much do the places they’re targeting spend on disaster preparedness?

## questions
- walk me through the finances. What is a break-even point? How does it differ from being cash positive?
- pricing of competitors? — WORK ON THIS
- their pricing model?
- How realistic is annual training at the same rate?



### notes from meeting, 30 March 2017
- Where is the validation / comparison of military / civilian?
- need something to validate the problem—show us why this is really an issue?
- where they company go if you invested?
- easy, cheaper supplement to training. During sequestration, cuts to training for the military. This might be a cheap alternative to maintain training during budget cuts
- advantage: randomness as opposed to a static scenario
- who they are : software development co, target government, simulation training, filling a niche segment, seeking $150k to hire new people and sell their company

competitors
- three large companies in the US
- competitors could just license the software
- target local places first
- other places they could target? private military companies
- haven’t discussed how to get the trainers
- faster than competitors? 
- hire someone to specifically look for state and local funds that could be used to pay for this software. It appears that competitors do this (http://www.trainingfordisastermanagement.com/resources/faqs/)
- positive selling points: maybe easy being acquired if there is growing demand in Latin America
don’t they need very few clients? They’re targeting places that have >= 100 people. If all people are trained, based on how they plan to bill people, that’s (40k * 4) + (10k * 3) = $190k. It’s unclear where their estimates for their net income are coming from. 240 / 50 ~ 5, so 5 * 30 = 150 people

# What are the main problems facing this company?
### my thoughts
- financing
	- it seems like it’s going to be really difficult to pass a bunch of bills at the state / local level
	- __solution__: look for federal grants to state / local agencies for smaller places. Have the trainers research these grants and approach potential clients.
- validation
	- there’s currently no validation that the technology works like it should
	- __solution__: commission a study to evaluate first responder performance? This would be costly though, and unclear what to compare it to
- breaking into the market
	- there are already similar products out there
	- __solution__: stress the stochastic nature of the simulation 
- a need?
	- need to convince first responders, etc. that this is something they need
	- they seem to be offering a product that's more customizable for the individual client's need
	- __solution__: stats on disasters predicted to increase? By 2040, 2 more major earthquakes per year in the US, average magnitude predicted to increase 0.1 points on Richter scale. data from [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/)

## from meeting
- need validation, esp. for willingness to pay
- market saturation
- competitors have deep pockets
- survey, interview data about a need
- how to show that instructors provide some value that a web-based training would not

Recommendations:
- these should address the major problems the company is facing
- start local
- private military companies
- hire a grant specialist — site on website & sales person that approaches clients
- do a study to validate that your methods work compared with no training or normal training methods
- could they change their pricing model to make more money?
- They only need 5 big clients = 75 days of instructor time. What are the instructors going to do in the meantime?
- By year 2, need 8 clients ~ 120 days of instructor time.


One thought I had this morning—based on their pricing structure, this company doesn’t have to land that many clients (5 clients with 100 employees to train in 2018; 8 in 2019). Another thing to consider: their instructors are going to have a lot of down time. We know they’re hiring two instructors to start based on their pricing structure, but if they have 5 clients in year one, that’s only something like 3 days * 5 sessions * 5 clients = 75 days of work. So the instructors are going to have a lot of time with nothing to do. Maybe part of their job could be finding grants that could be used to pay for the services the company provides?

### prepadedness grants

lots of grants from federal government to states / local govt’s for disaster preparedness

# notes on competitors
## ADMS
http://www.trainingfordisastermanagement.com/about/training-with-adms/

Training with ADMS is very similar to live-training, the difference being that the scene is built in a virtual reality environment, and trainees deploy virtual resources. This difference allows ADMS to go beyond the capabilities of live training. In an ADMS environment, all types of incidents can be created, and resources can be made available to match all the resources you would have access to in the real world.

Useful article? http://www.govtech.com/em/training/Simulation-Training-Cost-Effectiveness-Flexibility.html

Is ADMS Simulation available for online use?
No. ADMS was designed to foster a true to life environment for Commanders, Responders and Drivers, which includes working alongside of and interacting with team members. The most effective way to do this is by standing with your team as you would in a real life emergency. Online simulations lack the personal aspect of the exercise that makes ADMS so successful. Additionally, the quality of the graphics and simulation, and ultimately the value of the exercise, would be compromised due to data capacity limits associated with online environments.
Can Governmental grant money be used to purchase ADMS?
Yes. Many of our customers have purchased ADMS with the assistance of U.S. Federal, State or Local grants. We continually research funding sources which may be appropriate for our customers and post them on our website.

The ADMS-Command system will be located at the Fort McCoy Fire Department where it will be used to train approximately six hundred (600) military firefighters and two hundred (200) civilian firefighters annually. Trainees will include firefighters from the Department of Defense, U.S. Army, Army National Guard, Air National Guard, and surrounding civilian fire departments.
